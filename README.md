## GUI

### How to run the game with the GUI

Run `python gui/briscola_gui.py` and play!

### How to build an executable using *Pyinstaller*

1. Move to the GUI folder `cd briscola-rl/gui`
2. Run *Pyinstaller* `pyinstaller.py briscola_gui.spec` and wait...
3. You can find the executable `briscola_gui.exe` on `briscola-rl/gui/dist`

### Can I run the other files without using the GUI?    

Of course! If you run for example `human_vs_ai.py` it is recognized that you do not
want to use the GUI. (If there is any problem please do not hesitate to contact
me: [Alberto Ursino](mailto:albertoursino98@gmail.com?subject=[GitHub]%20Gui%20Briscola)).
